1. World event is triggered by mouse click on the virtual world.

2. After mouse is clicked, a 3x3 area around the clicked area turns from grass to flowers. Then a fruit spawns and rushes
towards the tombstone in the middle of the world.

3. The ghost nearest to the clicked point becomes an orange ghost and it also goes slower. Once fruit reaches tombstone,
it becomes a red ghost.

4. The new entity is the fruit. It uses A* to determine the best path it needs to take to reach the tombstone and follows
that path.
